# THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL APP

The above means that im in matter related or paid by the banking entity non the less, I beleive their system to be undeveloped (user experience-wise) and a more intuitive and smoother approch had to be developed.

This app is a simple chrome extension that features apollo client as a consumer of the [Banpro-api](https://github.com/victorstein/banpro-api) (unofficial) which I developed as well.

### Installation
